            When I'm not ensuring teams are productive while also maintaining a healthy work-life balance, I engage in the following activities.
        </h1>
        <h2>Working Out</h2>
        <p>I have a strong affinity for working out and staying active. It's not just a routine, but a passion that invigorates both my body and mind. Whether it's hitting the gym for a heart-pumping session or exploring the outdoors through activities like jogging and hiking, I find immense joy in pushing my physical limits. This dedication to fitness not only keeps me in good shape but also fosters a sense of discipline and resilience that I carry into various aspects of my life.</p>
